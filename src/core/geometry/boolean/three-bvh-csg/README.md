An _experimental, in progress_, flexible, memory compact, fast and dynamic CSG implementation on top of [three-mesh-bvh](https://github.com/gkjohnson/three-mesh-bvh). More than 100 times faster than other BSP-based three.js CSG libraries in complex cases. Contributions welcome!

> **Note**
> All brush geometry must be [two-manifold](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/maya-lt/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2015/ENU/MayaLT/files/Polygons-overview-Twomanifold-vs--nonmanifold-polygonal-geometry-htm.html) - or water tight with no triangle interpenetration.

> **Warning**
> Due to numerical precision and corner cases resulting geometry may not be correctly completely two-manifold.

# Use

```js
import { SUBTRACTION, Brush, Evaluator } from 'three-bvh-csg';
import { MeshStandardMaterial, Mesh, SphereGeometry, BoxGeometry } from 'three';

const csgEvaluator = new Evaluator();
const brush1 = new Brush( new SphereGeometry() );
const brush2 = new Brush( new BoxGeometry() );

const result = csgEvaluator.evaluate( brush1, brush2, SUBTRACTION );

// render the result!
```

# API

## Constants

### CSGOperations

CSG operations enums for use with `Evaluator`.

```
ADDITION
SUBTRACTION
DIFFERENCE
INTERSECTION
```

## Brush

_extends THREE.Mesh_

An object with the same interface as `THREE.Mesh` but used to evaluate CSG operations. Once a brush is created the geometry should not be modified.

> **Note**
>
> It is recommended to remove groups from a geometry before creating a brush if multi-material support is not required.

## Operation

_extends Brush_

This is an extension of the `Brush` class. With this class is possible to create a mesh and pass the CSG Operation constant to define which operation computes on the mesh. The result is a Mesh whose effect is defined from the operation selected. You can see how it works in the _hierarchy_ example.

### .operation

```js
operation = ADDITION : CSGOperation
```

The operation to perform on the next brush in processing chain when running `Evaluater.evaluateHierarchy`.

### .insertBefore

```js
insertBefore( brush : Brush )
```

Inserts the brush before the operation element that calls the method, in the list of the children of the operation's parent.

### .insertAfter

```js
insertAfter( brush : Brush )
```

Inserts the brush after the operation element that calls the method, in the list of the children of the operation's parent.

## OperationGroup

_extends THREE.Group_

A class with the same interface as `THREE.Group` but used to group a list of Operation mesh through the `.add` method inherited from the THREE.Group class. You can create a group starting from single Operation meshes as in the _hierarchy_ example.

## Evaluator

### .useGroups

```js
useGroups = true : Boolean
```

Whether to use geometry groups when processing the geometry. If geometry groups are used then a material array and groups will be assigned to the target `Brush` after processing. If groups are disabled then a single coherent piece of geometry with no groups will be produced.

### .evaluate

```js
evaluate(
	brushA : Brush,
	brushB : Brush,
	operation : CSGOperation,
	target = null : Brush | Mesh
) : Brush | Mesh
```

Performs the given `operation` on `brushA` with `brushB`. If no target is provided then a new `Brush` will be created with the new geometry. Otherwise the provided Brush will be _modified in place_ and geometry disposed or marked for update as needed.


### .evaluateHierarchy

```js
evaluateHierarchy(
  root: Opertation,
  target = new Brush : Brush | Mesh
) : Brush | Mesh
```

The method gets as parameters a root, an Operation mesh and a target if it is provided, otherwise, a new `Brush` will be created.
First sets the `updateMatrixWolrd` of the root to true then calls the traverse function with the root parameter to `evaluate` the mesh and its children.

```js
evaluate( brush, child, child.operation );
```

In this case, the arguments passed to `evaluate` is the `root` as `brushA`, the child as `brushB` and the `child.operation` as the operation to apply to the mesh.

## OperationDebugData

This class is used in the constructor of the Evaluator class. When the Evaluator is defined the constructor creates a debug property of type OperationDebugData and it is used to set the debug context, that is `addEdge` and `addIntersectionTriangles` to, for example, an EdgesHelper or a TriangleHelper.

### .enabled

```js
enabled = false : Boolean
```

Whether to collect the debug data during CSG operations which has a performance a memory cost.

### .intersectionEdges

```js
intersectionEdges = [] : Line3
```

A list of edges formed by intersecting triangles during the CSG process.

<!--
## EvaluatorWorker

_extends Evaluator_

### .evaluate

TODO

### .evaluateHierarchy

TODO

## GridMaterial

_extends THREE.MeshPhongMaterial_

A material with the same interface as `THREE.MeshPhongMaterial`. It adds a stylized grid on the mesh for more easily visualizing mesh topology and measurements.

### .enableGrid

```js
enableGrid = true : Boolean
```

Sets the visibility of the grid on the mesh.


## HalfEdgeMap

TODO

### constructor

```js
constructor( geometry : BufferGeometry = null )
```

### .getSiblingTriangleIndex

```js
getSiblingTriangleIndex( triIndex : Number, edgeIndex : 0 | 1 | 2 ) : Number
```

### .getSiblingEdgeIndex

```js
getSiblingEdgeIndex( triIndex : Number, edgeIndex : 0 | 1 | 2 ) : Number
```

### .updateFrom

```js
updateFrom( geometry : BufferGeometry ) : void
```

## PointsHelper

_extends THREE.InstancedMesh_

Helper class for generating spheres to display.

### .setPoints

```js
setPoints( points : Vector3[] ) : void;
```

Sets the points, passed as Vector3, and visualizes them as spheres.


## EdgesHelper

_extends THREE.LineSegments_

Helper class for generating a line to display the provided edges.

### .setEdges

```js
setEdges( edges : Line3[] ) : void
```

Sets the list of lines to be visualized.

## HalfEdgeMapHelper

_extends EdgesHelper_

This is a helper class that takes the `HalfEdgeMap` object and visualizes the connectivity between triangles.

### .setHalfEdges

```js
setHalfEdges( geometry : Geometry, halfEdges : HalfEdgeMap ) : void
```

Sets the half edge map to visualize along with the associated geometry.

## TriangleSetHelper

_extends THREE.Group_

Helper class for displaying a set of triangles. In the _Simple CSG_ example is possible to enable/disable the visibility of the triangles helper via `displayTriangleIntersections` checkbox.

The helper is composed of two meshes, one is a mesh with a MeshPhongMaterial and the other is a mesh with a LineBasicMaterial.

### .setTriangles

```js
setTriangles( triangles:  Triangle[] ) : void
```

Sets the geometry of the mesh and the line with the position of the triangles passed as a parameter of the method.

## Functions

### computeMeshVolume

```js
computeMeshVolume( mesh : Mesh | BufferGeometry ) : Number
```

Computes the volume of the given mesh in world space. The world matrix is expected to be updated before calling this function.

# Gotchas
- All geometry are expected to have all attributes being used and of the same type.
- Geometry on a Brush should be unique and not be modified after being set.
- All geometry must be [two-manifold](https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/maya-lt/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2015/ENU/MayaLT/files/Polygons-overview-Twomanifold-vs--nonmanifold-polygonal-geometry-htm.html) - or water tight with no triangle interpenetration.
